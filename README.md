# Amnesia

## WARNING!

THIS IS A FORK of the official repository to fit my own needs
([@SusanPotter](https://twitter.com/SusanPotter) - ask me on
Twitter what I am up to if you like).

My foreseeable needs are:

* To be able to install it as a rebar dependency (DONE)
* To offer session/state management capabilities (NOT DONE YET)
* Optional: add postgresql driver support (NOT DONE YET)

## OVERVIEW

Not to be confused with Mnesia. This is an Erlang library that
attempts to make accessing RDBMS database tables easier.

## LICENSE

Please see the license files in this repository for the original
notice.
