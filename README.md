# Amnesia

## WARNING!

THIS IS A FORK of the official repository to fit my own needs
(@SusanPotter - ask me on Twitter what I am up to if you like).

My needs are:
* To be able to install it as a rebar dependency (DONE)
* To offer session/state management capabilities (NOT DONE YET)
* Optional: add postgresql driver support (NOT DONE YET)

## OVERVIEW

Not to be confused with Mnesia. This is an Erlang library that
attempts to make accessing RDBMS database tables easier.

## LICENSE

Please see the license files in this repository for the original

The official repository appears to be on sourceforge.
